# scripts4Convenience
Personal repo of scripts I've written to simplify my life.

# Why?
So, a lot of the ideas I have sometimes require a lot of repetitive work, and I figure I can get around that simply by automation. 
Many of the scripts here are extremely simple. They often take a few inputs if any, and they function to do one thing- usually something that I needed in the moment. Sometimes, it is simply easier to open Python and write some gobbledygook. 
I intend to contribute to this whenever I can, which I imagine will be more often as I continue my studies towards a bachelor's degree in CS.
